# Major Project - Eric's Evolution Simulator
I want to make a project that simulates how evolution works. So there would be some kind of creature that starts out very basic. These creatures would reproduce and every time they reproduce there is a random chance for a random mutation. These mutations can be good or bad but if they are bad then the creature will probably not live long enough to reproduce and the mutation will die out. This is evolution and the basic idea of what I want to implement.

## Need to Have
- Looping space (If something goes off the bottom then it appears at the top)
- Asexual reproduction system (reproduction with one creature)
- Traits for the creature
- Random mutations
- Environment settings (You can design the environment)
- Creature settings (You can design that starting creature)

## Nice to Have
- Allosexual reproduction system (reproduction with two creatures)
- Ability to have multiple creatures
- Carnivore, omnivore and herbivore options
- Complex Hunting System (More than just bigger creature wins)
- Statistics UI (place to see the statistics of creature)
